  * Add ability to select connections by their handles, either individually or
    in groups with rect select.
  * Add ability to select connections directly
  * Add font size API
  * Adjust padding and placement to precisely fit text

    installation.  This version of flowcanvas is flowcanvas-1 and is NOT
    compatible with previous versions
  * Clean up API and improve documentation.
  * Clean up API/ABI by hiding private implementations.
  * Dramatically increase performance by rendering text manually rather than
    using the truly awful Gnome::Canvas::Text.

    connection searches and redundant connection collections).
  * Remove use of boost smart pointers.  Adding and removing from containers
    (e.g. Canvas, Module) is now done automatically.
  * Size empty ports in font based units so they look right when zoomed
  * Switch to GPLv3+
