ganv (1.4.0) stable;

  * Begin using library and pkg-config names suitable for parallel
    installation.  This version of flowcanvas is flowcanvas-1 and is
    NOT compatible with previous versions
  * Clean up API and improve documentation.
  * Add font size API
  * Use system theme font size by default
  * Size empty ports in font based units so they look right when zoomed
  * Adjust padding and placement to precisely fit text
  * Add ability to select connections directly
  * Add Connection::set_curved()
  * Fix lingering handle when deleting connections
  * Dramatically increase performance by rendering text manually
    rather than using the truly awful Gnome::Canvas::Text.
  * Remove use of boost smart pointers.  Adding and removing from containers
    (e.g. Canvas, Module) is now done automatically.
  * Clean up API/ABI by hiding private implementations.
  * Add ability to select connections by their handles, either individually
    or in groups with rect select.
  * Further slight improvements in memory consumption and alignment.
  * Improve scalability to graphs with many connections (eliminate linear
    connection searches and redundant connection collections).
  * Switch to GPLv3+
