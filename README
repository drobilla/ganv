Ganv
----

Ganv is an interactive Gtkmm canvas widget for graph-based interfaces
(patchers, modular synthesizers, finite state automata, interactive graphs,
etc).

Ganv provides classes for "Modules" (boxes with "Ports"), Circles, and
Edges (lines that connect either Ports or Circles).  The user can rearrange
items, or Ganv can automatically arrange items using GraphViz.  Edges can
be made by the user one at a time with the mouse, or in groups using the mouse
and keyboard.
